## Overview

The **Decentralized AI Model Marketplace** is built on Web3 technologies, integrating Ethereum smart contracts and IPFS for decentralized storage. Developers can register AI models with metadata stored on-chain, while buyers purchase models using crypto payments. For secure access, files are stored on **Private IPFS via Pinata**, which generates time-limited signed URLs for authorized downloads.

## Features

- **Model Registration & Metadata:**  
  Developers can register models with details (name, description, price, and IPFS CID) stored on-chain.
- **Secure File Storage:**  
  Integrates with **Pinata Private IPFS** to securely store AI models and generate temporary signed URLs.
- **Decentralized Payments:**  
  Buyers purchase models with **cryptocurrency**, with funds transferred directly to the developerâ€™s wallet.
- **Modern, Responsive UI:**  
  A sleek frontend built with **React and Vite** that supports wallet connectivity (e.g., MetaMask).
- **Robust Testing:**  
  Comprehensive testing for smart contracts (using Hardhat, Mocha, Chai), frontend (Jest, Selenium), and API endpoints (Postman).
